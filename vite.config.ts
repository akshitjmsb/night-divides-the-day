// No service worker is generated. The app previously precached its shell via
// vite-plugin-pwa, but on installed iOS/Safari PWAs a stale precached shell
// repeatedly stranded devices on old, broken code that no update could reach
// (the shell JS that drives a worker update can't run while the old worker is
// still serving the old shell). We ship a self-destroying `public/sw.js`
// instead. `public/sw.js` is now notification-only: it has no fetch handler and
// never caches an app asset, so every launch still loads current code straight
// from the CDN. Installability (manifest + icons) is unaffected.
