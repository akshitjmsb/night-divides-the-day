Scene:

The sun sets over the dusty streets of Kasur, painting the sky in shades of orange and gold. In a small courtyard behind the mosque, Bulleh Shah sits cross-legged on a worn mat. The evening breeze carries the scent of jasmine and the distant sound of children playing.

His white robe is simple, his turban slightly askew. His hands rest on his knees, palms facing upward. His eyes are closed, but his face is alive with emotion. Around him, the courtyard is quiet except for the rustling of leaves and the soft cooing of pigeons on the roof.

He opens his eyes slowly, looking at the setting sun. His weathered face shows years of seeking and wisdom. He takes a deep breath, feeling the cool evening air fill his lungs. The world around him seems to pause, as if waiting for his words.

His voice is gentle but strong as he speaks:

"Bulleh Shah, asaan yaar milya hai, asaan yaar milya hai
Jis de naal khelan khushiyan, oh yaar milya hai"

He pauses, letting the words hang in the air. His eyes shine with tears of joy. He continues:

"Jis de naal khelan khushiyan, oh yaar milya hai
Jis de naal khelan khushiyan, oh yaar milya hai"

The words echo softly in the courtyard. He smiles, a deep, peaceful smile that reaches his eyes. His hands move slightly, as if he's holding something precious.

"Bulleh Shah has found his beloved," he whispers to himself. "The one who brings joy to my heart."

He looks around at the simple courtyard, at the setting sun, at the pigeons on the roof. Everything seems to glow with a new light. His heart feels full, overflowing with love and gratitude.

The evening call to prayer begins in the distance, but he doesn't move. He sits there, feeling the presence of his beloved in every breath, in every moment. The world around him is transformed - not because it has changed, but because he has found what he was seeking.
