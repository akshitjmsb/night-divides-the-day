Hazaron khwahishen aisi ke har khwahish pe dam nikle
Bohat nikle mere armaan lekin phir bhi kam nikle

Translation:
Thousands of wishesâ€”each so big, it could take my breath away.
Many of my dreams came true, but still, it feels too little.

Meaning:
This couplet expresses the human condition of endless desire. Even when some wishes are fulfilled, we always want more. The poet reflects on how many of his dreams have been realized, yet he still feels unsatisfied, always yearning for more. It's a meditation on the nature of human longing and the fact that fulfillment often leads to new desires.
