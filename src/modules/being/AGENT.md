# Being module

- **id:** `being`
- **ring:** circle (soul — opens a quiet page, leaves no record by default)
- **renderer:** dom
- **permissions:** timer, storage

## Purpose

Being owns the home orbit's Vitruvian reset and four dedicated Sukoon pillar
pages. Food owns the fifth page.

- **Centre reset** — tapping the Vitruvian Man immediately starts a continuous
  4-second inhale / 6-second exhale guide with the existing OM loop at quiet
  volume. It continues through screen lock; a second tap stops it and it
  retains nothing.

- **Sleep** — from 5:00–17:59, Outside starts a session-only ten-minute timer.
  At night the shared system dim is already automatic, so Sleep adds no second
  control. Neither behavior leaves a record.
- **Food** — a session-only next-meal cue rendered by the shell from the Food
  module, keeping the module boundary intact.
- **Movement** — one page ordered as Routine, Weights, then Stretch. The
  tennis routine's three warm-up and five workout pointers expand into publisher
  tutorials under one minute. Only the opened tutorial loads a YouTube player;
  closing or leaving it stops playback. Stretch Now, the full Stretch library,
  and the deterministic, fully-offline Weights pointers remain visible below.
- **Mindfulness** — Breathe, OM, and Focus. Breathe begins immediately with a
  continuous 4-in / 6-out audio guide that survives screen lock and stops from
  the Vitruvian Man. Focus begins immediately from one of four fixed choices:
  5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes.
  Audio uses HTMLAudioElement for iOS autoplay reliability.
- **Rooh** — relationships, safety, and co-regulation.

Every pillar page contains only its approved icon-led action pointers. Do
not add teaching or supporting prose without explicit Product Owner approval.
